# UnityKinematicMovement2D

The goal of this project is to create a code base for movement systems that uses the kinematic rigidbody of the Unity Engine instead of the engine's physics system.

My hopes are that this project will serve as a great experimental gray box game to learn more about the game design implications of tweeking movement in 2D games. Also I will be able to experiment with the use of code patterns to better explore the reusabillity of my code between game projects.

This project aim at offering:
- Game object velocity control in 2D space.
- Handling physical collision between objects.
- Reusability by the use of composition and observer pattern.
